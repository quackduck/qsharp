**Input:** None.

**Goal:** Generate a $0$ or $1$ with equal probability.
> _Hint_: Use the allocated qubit, apply a quantum gate to it, measure it and use the result to return a $0$ or $1$.

**Stretch goal:** Can you find a different way to implement this operation?
> _Hint_: What are the different quantum states that produce $0$ and $1$ measurement results with the same probability? How would measuring the qubit in a different basis change the result?
