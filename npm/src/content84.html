<p>The input qubit is guaranteed to be either in basis state $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$. This means that when measuring the qubit in the computational basis, the measurement will report the input state without any doubt.</p>
<p>In Q# the operation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.m" target="_blank"><code>M</code></a> can be used to measure a single qubit in the computational basis. The measurement result is a value of type <code>Result</code> - the operation <code>M</code> will return <code>One</code> if the input qubit was in the $|1\rangle$ state and <code>Zero</code> if the input qubit was in the $|0\rangle$ state. Since we need to encode the first case as <code>false</code> and the second one as <code>true</code>, we can return the result of equality comparison between measurement result and <code>Zero</code>.</p>
