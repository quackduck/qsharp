<p>For this problem, we follow the procedure given in the &quot;Measurements in Arbitrary Orthogonal Bases&quot; section of the Kata.
As noted in the solution of the &quot;Distinguishing Orthogonal States: 2&quot; exercise, the gate $R_x(-\theta)$, with $\theta = 2\alpha$ transforms the $\ket A/\ket B$ states to the $\ket 0/\ket 1$ states:
$$R_x(-\theta) \ket A = \ket 0,$$
$$R_x(-\theta) \ket B = \ket 1.$$
Hence, we first apply $R_x(-\theta)$ to the qubit. Next, we measure in the computational basis using the <code>M</code> operation.
If the <code>M</code> operation returned <code>Zero</code>, we get measurement outcome $A$, and if it returned <code>One</code>, we get measurement outcome $B$.</p>
<p>After the measurement, we apply the inverse of the $R_x(-\theta)$ gate, which is the $R_x(\theta)$ gate.
The final rotation ensures that the state of the qubit is in the state corresponding to the measurement outcome.</p>
