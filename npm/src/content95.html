<p>Congratulations! In this kata you learned how to apply measurements on single-qubit systems. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measurements are always done in an orthogonal basis. By default, we choose the computational basis $\lbrace \ket{0}, \ket{1} \rbrace$.</li>
<li>Measurements are represented as projector operators, which are matrices.</li>
<li>Unlike quantum gates, measurements are neither unitary nor reversible. When we measure a qubit, the state of the qubit collapses to one of the basis states, and the initial state is lost. </li>
<li>In Q#, you can implement measurements in the computational basis using the <code>M</code> operation, and in the Pauli basis using the <code>Measure</code> operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you will learn about measurements in multi-qubit systems in the &quot;Measurements in Multi-Qubit Systems&quot; kata.</p>
