<p>In this demo we show how you could test an oracle that you&#39;ve implemented for your own problem. 
For all of the previous oracles that you&#39;ve implemented, we&#39;ve been testing your oracle against a reference solution for that task. 
However, if you&#39;re designing an oracle for a new problem, you do not have a reference solution for it - if you did, there would be no point for you to program the oracle in the first place!</p>
<p>A good way to test a quantum oracle of interest is to write a classical oracle that performs the same computation classically, and then compare the effect of your quantum oracle on the basis states with the output of the classical oracle for every input (or a lot of the inputs if you are constrained by runtime) to ensure that they match.</p>
<p>Here we will compare the reference implementation of <code>Meeting_Oracle</code> to the classical code implementing the same function.</p>
