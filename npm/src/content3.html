<p>Once you have successfully implemented a solution or if you are stuck on a problem, you can consult our reference solution, which contains additional details on how to solve the exercise.</p>
<p>For this exercise, you can solve the problem by simply using Q#&#39;s <code>X</code> operation on the input qubit, which will perform a &quot;bit flip&quot; and set the qubit into the $|1\rangle$ state.</p>
