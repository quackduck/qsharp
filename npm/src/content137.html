<p>Consider the function $f(x)$ that takes $3$ bits of input and returns $1$ if $x=101$ or $x=010$, and $0$ otherwise.</p>
<p>The phase oracle that implements this function will take an array of 3 qubits as an input, flip the sign of basis states $|101\rangle$ and $|010\rangle$, and leave the rest of the basis states unchanged. Let&#39;s see the effect of this oracle on a superposition state.</p>
