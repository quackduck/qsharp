<p>So far, we have discussed measurements done in the computational basis, that is, the ${ \ket 0, \ket 1}$ basis.</p>
<p>It is also possible to implement measurements in other orthogonal bases, such as the Pauli X basis, which consists of the two vectors $\ket + = \frac1{\sqrt2} \big(\ket 0 +\ket 1\big)$, and $\ket - = \frac1{\sqrt2} \big(\ket 0 -\ket 1\big)$. Q# has a built-in operation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.measure" target="_blank"><code>Measure</code></a> for measurements in the Pauli bases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>Measure</code> operation can be used for measuring multiple qubits in a multi-qubit system; however, in this kata we only consider measurements for single-qubit systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are $\pm 1$, with one eigenvector corresponding to each eigenvalue. For any chosen Pauli basis, the <code>Measure</code> operation returns <code>Zero</code> if the measurement outcome corresponds to the eigenvalue $+1$, and returns <code>One</code> if the measurement outcome corresponds to the eigenvalue $-1$. As in the case of the computational basis measurements, the wave function of the qubit collapses to the corresponding state after the measurement is executed.</p>
<p>The probabilities of the outcomes are defined using a similar rule: to measure a state $\ket \psi$ in a Pauli basis ${ \ket {b_0}, \ket {b_1}}$, we represent it as a linear combination of the basis vectors
$$\ket \psi = c_0 \ket {b_0} + c_1 \ket {b_1}.$$</p>
<p>The probabilities of outcomes $\ket{b_0}$ and $\ket{b_1}$ will be defined as $|c_0|^2$, and $|c_1|^2$, respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computational basis measurement is often referred to as measurement in Pauli Z basis. Indeed, the eigenvectors of the Z gate are $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$, with eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$, respectively.</p>
