<p>Congratulations! In this kata you learned how to apply measurements on multi-qubit systems. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full measurements: you measure all the qubits simultaneously in an orthogonal basis ($2^n$ possible outcomes).</li>
<li>Partial measurements: you measure $m$ qubits out of $n$, for $m&lt; n$ ($2^m$ possible outcomes).</li>
<li>Joint measurement: Pauli measurement of all $n$ qubits ($2$ possible outcomes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you will implement a quantum algorithm to generate random numbers in &quot;Quantum Random Number Generation&quot; kata.</p>
