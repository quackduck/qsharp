<p>Joint measurement is a generalization of the measurement in the computational basis.
Pauli measurements can also be generalized to a larger number of qubits. A multi-qubit Pauli measurement corresponds to an operator $M_1 \otimes \dotsc \otimes M_n$, with each $M_i$ being from the set of gates ${X,Y,Z,I}$. If at least one of the operators is not the identity matrix, then the measurement can result in two outcomes: a <code>Result</code> of <code>Zero</code> corresponding to eigenvalue $+1$ and a <code>Result</code> of <code>One</code> corresponding to the eigenvalue $-1$. The corresponding projection operators are the projections onto the corresponding eigenspaces.</p>
<p>For example, a Pauli/joint measurement corresponding to the $X\otimes Z$ operator can be characterized as follows:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Eigenvalue</th>
        <th>Measurement Result in Q#</th>
        <th>Eigenbasis</th>
        <th>Measurement Projector</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$+1$</td>
        <td>Zero</td>
        <td>$\{ \ket{0,+}, \ket{1,-} \}$</td>
        <td>$P_{+1} = \ket{0,+}\bra{0,+} +  \ket{1,-} \bra{1,-}$</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$-1$</td>
        <td>One</td>
        <td>$\{ \ket{0,-}, \ket{1,+} \}$</td>
        <td>$P_{-1} = \ket{0,-}\bra{0,-} +  \ket{1,+} \bra{1,+}$</td>
     </tr>
 </table>

<p> The rules for measurements are then the same as those outlined in the partial measurements section, with the projection operators in the table.</p>

<p><strong>Parity measurement in different basis</strong></p>
<p>Consider a system which is in a state $\alpha |00\rangle + \beta |01\rangle + \beta |10\rangle + \alpha |11\rangle$.</p>
<p>What are the possible outcomes and their associated probabilities, if a measurement in an $XX$ Pauli measurement is done?</p>
<details>
<summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
The first step towards identifying the outcomes and their probabilities for joint measurements is to identify the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues $\pm1$ of the Pauli operator. We note that since $X\ket{\pm}= \pm\ket{\pm}$, we have

<p>$$XX \ket{++} = \ket{++}$$
$$XX \ket{--} = \ket{--}$$
$$XX \ket{+-} = -\ket{+-}$$
$$XX \ket{-+} = -\ket{-+}$$</p>
<p>Thus, the $XX$ operator measures the parity in the Hadamard, or the $\ket{\pm}$ basis. That is, it distinguishes basis states with an even number of $+$&#39;s from basis states which have an odd number of $+$&#39;s.</p>
<p>The projector corresponding to a result of <code>Zero</code> is given by $P_{+1} = \ket{++}\bra{++} + \ket{--}\bra{--}$, while the projector corresponding to a result of <code>One</code> is given by $P_{-1} = \ket{+-}\bra{+-} + \ket{-+}\bra{-+}$. Then, we note that $P_{+1}$ annihilates states with odd parity, while leaving states with even parity unaffected. That is, for any values of the constants 
$$P_{+1} ( \gamma \ket{++} + \delta \ket{--} ) =$$
$$( \gamma \ket{++} + \delta \ket{--} )P_{+1} ( \mu \ket{-+} + \nu \ket{+-} ) = 0$$</p>
<p>Similarly, $P_{-1}$ annihilates states with even parity, while leaving states with odd parity unaffected.</p>
<p>Now we express the given state in the Hadamard basis. We note that it is possible to go from the computational basis to the Hadamard basis using the following relations:
$$\ket{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{+} + \ket{-} \right)$$
$$\ket{1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{+} - \ket{-} \right)$$</p>
<p>Using these, we obtain
$$ \alpha |00\rangle + \beta |01\rangle + \beta |10\rangle + \alpha |11\rangle = (\alpha + \beta) |++\rangle + (\alpha - \beta) |--\rangle$$
Thus, this state has an even parity in the Hadamard basis. It follows that an $XX$ Pauli measurement will result in the outcome <code>Zero</code> with probability 1, leaving the state unchanged after the measurement.</p>
