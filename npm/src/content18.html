<p>There is another way to represent quantum gates, this time using Dirac notation. However, the kets we&#39;ve been using aren&#39;t enough to represent arbitrary matrices. We need to introduce another piece of notation: the <strong>bra</strong> (this is why Dirac notation is sometimes called <strong>bra-ket notation</strong>).</p>
<p>Recall that kets represent column vectors; a bra is a ket&#39;s row vector counterpart. For any ket $|\psi\rangle$, the corresponding bra is its adjoint (conjugate transpose): $\langle\psi| = |\psi\rangle^\dagger$.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Ket</th>
    <th>Bra</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$</td>
    <td>$\langle0| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$|1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$</td>
    <td>$\langle1| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$|i\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\\ \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}$</td>
    <td>$\langle i| = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\\ \beta \end{bmatrix}$</td>
    <td>$\langle\psi| = \begin{bmatrix} \overline{\alpha} & \overline{\beta} \end{bmatrix}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$</td>
    <td>$\langle\psi| = \overline{\alpha}\langle0| + \overline{\beta}\langle1|$</td>
  </tr>

<p>Kets and bras give us a neat way to express inner and outer products. The inner product of $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$ is the matrix product of $\langle\phi|$ and $|\psi\rangle$, denoted as $\langle\phi|\psi\rangle$, and their outer product is the matrix product of $|\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\psi|$, denoted as $|\phi\rangle\langle\psi|$. Notice that the norm of $|\psi\rangle$ is $\sqrt{\langle\psi|\psi\rangle}$.</p>
<p>This brings us to representing matrices. Recall that the outer product of two vectors of the same size produces a square matrix. We can use a linear combination of several outer products of simple vectors (such as basis vectors) to express any square matrix. For example, the $X$ gate can be expressed as follows:</p>
<p>$$X = |0\rangle\langle1| + |1\rangle\langle0|$$</p>
<p>$$
|0\rangle\langle1| + |1\rangle\langle0| =
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>This representation can be used to carry out calculations in Dirac notation without ever switching back to matrix representation:</p>
<p>$$X|0\rangle = \big(|0\rangle\langle1| + |1\rangle\langle0|\big)|0\rangle = |0\rangle\langle1|0\rangle + |1\rangle\langle0|0\rangle = |0\rangle\big(\langle1|0\rangle\big) + |1\rangle\big(\langle0|0\rangle\big) = |0\rangle(0) + |1\rangle(1) = |1\rangle$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That last step may seem a bit confusing. Recall that $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ form an <strong>orthonormal basis</strong>. That is, they are both normalized, and they are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p>A vector is normalized if its norm is equal to $1$, which only happens if its inner product with itself is equal to $1$. This means that $\langle0|0\rangle = \langle1|1\rangle = 1$</p>
<p>Two vectors are orthogonal to each other if their inner product equals $0$. This means that $\langle0|1\rangle = \langle 1|0\rangle = 0$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general case, a matrix 
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{00} &amp; a_{01} \\ a_{10} &amp; a_{11} \end{bmatrix}$$
will have the following ket-bra representation:
$$A = a_{00} |0\rangle\langle0| + a_{01} |0\rangle\langle1| + a_{10} |1\rangle\langle0| + a_{11} |1\rangle\langle1|$$</p>
