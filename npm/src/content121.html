<p>Recall from the Qubit kata that a qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ is defined via the basis states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ as $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \ \beta \end{bmatrix} = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$, where $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$</p>
<p>We call $\alpha$ and $\beta$ the probability amplitudes of states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, respectively. When $|\psi\rangle$ is measured in the $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$ basis (the computational basis), the probabilities of the outcomes are defined based on the state amplitudes: there is a $|\alpha|^2$ probability that the measurement result will be $0$, and a $|\beta|^2$ probability that the measurement result will be $1$.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a qubit in state $\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}$ will yield measurement results $0$ or $1$ with equal probability, while a qubit in state $\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt3}{2} \end{bmatrix}$ will yield measurement result $0$ only 25% of the time, and $1$ 75% of the time.</p>

<p>This knowledge is sufficient to implement a simple random number generator!</p>
