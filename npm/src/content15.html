<p>Congratulations! In this kata you learned the basics of qubits and qubit states. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A qubit is a basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a bit in classical computing.</li>
<li>Superposition is a quantum phenomenon where a qubit is in a combination of both 0 and 1 states. When measured, a qubit goes from being in superposition to one of the classical states.</li>
<li>A qubit can be represented as $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers and state vectors $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are $0$ and $1$ states respectively.</li>
<li>In Q#, qubits are represented by the <code>Qubit</code> data type. When simulating a quantum program, you can use <code>DumpMachine</code> to inspect the state of a qubit without disturbing it.</li>
</ul>
