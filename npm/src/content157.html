<p>Suppose that you would like to schedule a meeting with your co-worker Jasmine.
You both work five day workweeks, and $|x\rangle$ and $|jasmine\rangle$ are 5-bit states representing your and Jasmine&#39;s schedules.
The schedules are indicators of a person being busy on that day: a $1$ bit means that person is busy on that day, and $0$ means they&#39;re free for a meeting that day. Implement a function that determines if you and Jasmine can schedule a meeting during the week, i.e., whether there is a day when both schedules have a $0$ simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>5 qubits in an arbitrary state $|x\rangle$ representing your schedule for the week (input/query register).</li>
<li>5 qubits in an arbitrary state $|jasmine\rangle$ representing Jasmine&#39;s schedule for the week (input/query register).</li>
<li>A qubit in an arbitrary state $|y\rangle$ (target qubit).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Flip the state of $|y\rangle$ if you and Jasmine are both free on the same day for at least one day during the week.  Recall that a $0$ means that a person is free on that day.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If $|x\rangle=|10101\rangle$ and $|jasmine\rangle=|01010\rangle$, do nothing (there is no day on which you both are free).</li>
<li>If $|x\rangle=|10001\rangle$ and $|jasmine\rangle=|01010\rangle$, flip the state $|y\rangle$ (you are both free on Wednesday).</li>
<li>If $|x\rangle=|00000\rangle$ and $|jasmine\rangle=|00000\rangle$, flip the state $|y\rangle$ (you are both free all week).</li>
<li>If $|x\rangle=|11111\rangle$ and $|jasmine\rangle=|11111\rangle$, do nothing (you are both busy all week).</li>
</ul>

  <summary><b>Before implementing this oracle, answer the question: are you implementing a marking or a phase oracle?</b></summary>
    This is a marking oracle, because we are flipping the state of the target qubit $|y\rangle$ based on the state of the inputs $|x\rangle$ and $|jasmine\rangle$. Notice that even though we do not have the typical single-input-register situation that we saw earlier, this is still a marking oracle.
