<p>Using the <code>M</code> operation in Q#, we demonstrate that the simulated outcome probabilities and post-measurement outcomes match the theoretical values obtained using the projection operators as described above. We use the Hardy state from Exercise 4 with a computational basis measurement on the first qubit for this purpose.</p>
<p>The simulated and theoretical measurement probabilities are not expected to match exactly, but should be close to each other, since measurement is probabilistic. However, the post-measurement states from the simulation should match the expected states for Exercise 4 precisely, since partial state collapse is not a probabilistic process.</p>
