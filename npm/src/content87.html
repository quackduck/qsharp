<p>The input qubit is guaranteed to be either in basis state $|+\rangle$ or $|-\rangle$. This means that when measuring the qubit in the Pauli X basis, the measurement will report the input state without any doubt. (Recall that these states are eigenstates for the Pauli X matrix).</p>
<p>In Q# the operation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.measure" target="_blank"><code>Measure</code></a> can be used to measure a qubit in Pauli basis of the user&#39;s choice. The operation returns a value of type <code>Result</code> and is <code>Zero</code> if the measured state corresponds to the eigenvalue $+1$, and <code>One</code> if it corresponds to the eigenvalue $-1$ of the Pauli operator.</p>
<p>Since the states $\ket +$ and $\ket -$ correspond to the eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$ of the Pauli X operator, we can return the result of equality comparison between the measurement result and <code>One</code>.
Note that since <code>Measure</code> operation generally works with multiple qubits to perform multi-qubit measurements, it takes array parameters. To do a single-qubit measurement, you need to pass two arrays of one element, <code>[PauliX]</code> and <code>[q]</code>, rather than individual values.</p>
