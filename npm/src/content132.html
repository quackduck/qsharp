<p>Congratulations! In this kata you have created a random number generator. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>This code will generate truly random numbers when executed on a true quantum computer. Random numbers obtained when executing on a simulator are only as good as the source of randomness used by the simulator.</li>
<li>You can generate a random bit by applying a Hadamard gate to a state $\ket{0}$, and then measuring the resulting qubit in the computational basis.</li>
<li>The Q# <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.math.bitsizei" target="_blank">BitSizeI function</a> returns the number of bits needed to write an integer in binary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
