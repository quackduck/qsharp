<p>Congratulations!  In this kata you learned the matrix and the ket-bra representation of quantum gates. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-qubit gates act on individual qubits and are represented by $2 \times 2$ unitary matrices.</li>
<li>The effect of a gate applied to a qubit can be calculated by multiplying the corresponding matrix by the state vector of the qubit.</li>
<li>Applying several quantum gates in sequence is equivalent to performing several matrix multiplications.</li>
<li>Any square matrix can be represented as a linear combination of the outer products of vectors. The outer product is the matrix product of $|\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\psi|$, denoted as $|\phi\rangle\langle\psi|$.</li>
<li>Pauli gates, phase shift gates, and rotation gates are examples of single-qubit gates. All of them are available in Q#.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you will learn about multi-qubit systems and the multi-qubit gates in the “Multi-Qubit Systems” kata.</p>
