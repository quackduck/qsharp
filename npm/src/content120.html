<p>True random number generation is a notoriously difficult problem. Many &quot;random&quot; generators today are actually pseudo-random, using a starting seed to spawn seemingly-random numbers that are actually a repeatable function of that seed. Most true random number generators are based on measurements of some natural phenomenon, such as atmospheric noise or atomic decay. You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are truly random. The quantum algorithm for random number generation is one of the simplest applications of quantum computing principles, requiring very few qubits to run.</p>
