<p>Any multi-qubit state can be prepared from the $|0...0\rangle$ state using an appropriate combination of quantum gates.
However, sometimes it is easier and more efficient to prepare a state using partial measurements.
You could prepare a simpler state involving additional qubits, which, when measured, result in a collapse of the remaining qubits to the desired state with a high probability. This is called <strong>post-selection</strong>, and is particularly useful if it is easier to prepare the pre-measurement state with the extra qubits than to prepare the desired state directly using unitary gates alone. This is demonstrated by the following exercise.</p>
