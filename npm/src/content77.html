<p>Congratulations! You have completed the series of introductory katas. In this kata you learned how to apply quantum gates to multi-qubit systems. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind: </p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-qubit gates are constructed as the tensor products of gates that affect individual qubits of the system.</li>
<li>CNOT gate is a type of controlled gate that acts on two qubits. If the control qubit is in state $\ket{1}$, it applies the $X$ gate to the target qubit, otherwise it does nothing.</li>
<li>In Q#, controlled gates are applied using the <code>Controlled</code> functor.</li>
<li>In Q# you can apply a sequence of multi-qubit gates, regardless of whether the qubits are adjacent or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you will learn about quantum measurements in the &quot;Measurements in Single-Qubit Systems&quot; kata.</p>
