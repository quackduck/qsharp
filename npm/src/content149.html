<p>In this section you will implement a few more complicated quantum oracles. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that the operation declarations below require adjoint and controlled variants of the oracle to be automatically generated. This is common practice that makes testing and reusing the code easier. Typically Q# compiler will easily generate these variants, as long as you don&#39;t use mutable variables or operations that don&#39;t support these functors.</p>
