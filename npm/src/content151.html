<p>Notice that you can modify the state of the input register during your computations (this is what <code>ControlledOnInt</code> function does under the hood). However, it is essential to undo those modifications (&quot;uncompute&quot; the changes), except the final one, so that the oracle will preserve the input if it is a basis state.</p>
