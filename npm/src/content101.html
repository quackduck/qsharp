<p><strong>Input:</strong> Two qubits (stored in an array of length 2) which are guaranteed to be in one of the four basis states ($|00\rangle$, $|01\rangle$, $|10\rangle$, or $|11\rangle$).</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0 if the qubits were in the $|00\rangle$ state,</li>
<li>1 if they were in the $|01\rangle$ state, </li>
<li>2 if they were in the $|10\rangle$ state, </li>
<li>3 if they were in the $|11\rangle$ state.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this task and the subsequent ones the order of qubit states in task description matches the order of qubits in the array (i.e., $|10\rangle$ state corresponds to <code>qs[0]</code> in state $|1\rangle$ and <code>qs[1]</code> in state $|0\rangle$).</p>
<p>The state of the qubits at the end of the operation does not matter.</p>
