<p>Congratulations! In this kata you have learned to build quantum oracles. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quantum oracle is an &quot;opaque box&quot; operation that is used as input to another algorithm.</li>
<li>Phase oracles encode the information in the relative phase of basis states. If $f(x)=0$, the oracle doesn&#39;t change the basis state $\ket{x}$, and if $f(x)=1$ it multiplies the phase of the basis state $\ket{x}$ by $-1$.</li>
<li>Marking oracles use an extra qubit $\ket{y}$ and encode the information in the state of that qubit. If $f(x)=0$, it doen&#39;t change the state of the qubit $\ket{y}$ for the basis state $\ket{x}$, and if $f(x)=1$ it flips the state of the qubit $\ket{y} for the basis state $\ket{x}$.</li>
</ul>
