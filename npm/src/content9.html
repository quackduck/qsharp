<p>The exact behavior of this operation called <code>RunExample</code> depends on the quantum simulator or processor you are using.</p>
<p>On the simulator used in these demos, this function prints the information on each basis state that has a non-zero amplitude, one basis state per row.
This includes information about the amplitude of the state, the probability of measuring that state, and the phase of the state.</p>
<p>Note that each row has the following format:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Basis State<br>(|𝜓ₙ…𝜓₁⟩)</th>
            <th>Amplitude</th>
            <th>Measurement Probability</th>
            <th>Phase</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
</table>

<p>For example, the state $|0\rangle$ would be represented as follows:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>|0⟩</td>
            <td>1.0000+0.0000𝑖</td>
            <td>100.0000%</td>
            <td>↑ 0.0000</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>It is important to note that although we reason about quantum systems in terms of their state, Q# does not have any representation of the quantum state in the language. Instead, state is an internal property of the quantum system, modified using gates.
