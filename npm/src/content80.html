<p>In this demo, we prepare a qubit in the state $0.6|0\rangle + 0.8|1\rangle$, and then measure it in the computational basis. In Q#, single-qubit measurements in the computational basis can be implemented using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.m" target="_blank">M operation</a>. It will return the constant <code>Zero</code> if measurement result was $0$ or the constant <code>One</code> if the measurement result was $1$. <code>Zero</code> and <code>One</code> are constants of type <code>Result</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you run this code multiple times, you will notice that whenever the measurement outcome is $1$, the post-measurement state of the qubit is $\ket 1$, and similarly for $0$. This is in line with our expectation that after the measurement the wave function &#39;collapses&#39; to the corresponding state.</p>
