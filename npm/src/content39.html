<p>This kata introduces you to multi-qubit systems - their representation in mathematical notation and in Q# code, and the concept of entanglement.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with single-qubit systems, we recommend that you complete &quot;The Qubit&quot; kata first.</p>
<p><strong>This kata covers the following topics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vector representation of multi-qubit systems</li>
<li>Entangled and separable states</li>
<li>Dirac notation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you should know to start working on this kata:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Basic single-qubit gates</li>
<li>The concept of tensor product</li>
</ul>
