<p>Now that you can generate a single random bit, you can use that logic to create random multi-bit numbers. Let&#39;s try first to make a two-bit number by combining two randomly generated bits.</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Generate a random number in the range $[0, 3]$ with an equal probability of getting each of the four numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch goal:</strong> Can you do this without allocating qubits in this operation?</p>

  Remember that you can use previously defined operations to implement your solution. For convenience, the <b>RandomBit</b> operation is already available for you to use in this exercise.
