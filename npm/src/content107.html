<p><strong>Input</strong>: A 3-qubit system which is guaranteed to be in either the $\ket{++-}$ state, or the $\ket{---}$ state.</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>0 if the qubit is in the $\ket{++-}$ state,</li>
<li>1 if the qubit is in the $\ket{---}$ state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The state of the qubits at the end of the operation should be the same as the initial state.</p>
