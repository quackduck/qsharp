<p><strong>Inputs:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Two qubits in an arbitrary state $|\phi\rangle$, stored as an array of length 2.</li>
<li>An angle $\theta$: $-\pi &lt; \theta \leq \pi$.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Apply a controlled $R_x$ gate, using the first qubit as control and the second qubit as target, with $\theta$ as the angle argument for the gate.</p>
<details>
    <summary><b>Need a hint?</b></summary>
    <p>If you were to apply a regular version of $R_x$ gate, it would take two parameters - angle $theta$ as the first parameter and the target qubit as the second parameter.</p>
