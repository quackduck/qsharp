<p>The starting state can be represented as follows:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = |0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle $$</p>
<p>The goal state can be represented as follows:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = |1\rangle \otimes |1\rangle $$</p>
<p>Applying an <strong>X</strong> gate to a qubit in the $|0\rangle$ state transforms the qubit state into the $|1\rangle$ state. So, if we apply the <strong>X</strong> gate on the first qubit and the second qubit, we get the desired state.</p>
