<p>Congratulations! In this kata you learned to prepare separable multi-qubit states using only single-qubit gates. You also learned the difference between separable states an entangled states. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system of $N$ qubits can also be in a superposition of $2^N$ quantum states. The computational basis for an $N$-qubit system is a set of $2^N$ vectors.</li>
<li>Any two-qubit system can be expressed as some linear combination of the tensor product of single-qubit basis states.</li>
<li>Two qubits are entangled if their states are correlated and if they can&#39;t be described as two independent qubits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you will learn about multi-qubit gates and how they can give you access to all states of multi-qubit systems in the &quot;Multi-Qubit Gates&quot; kata.</p>
