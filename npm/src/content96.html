<p>In the previous kata, we discussed the concept of measurements done on single-qubit systems.
Building upon those ideas, this kata will introduce you to measurements done on multi-qubit systems, and how to implement such measurements in Q#.
This will include measuring a single qubit in a multi-qubit system, as well as measuring multiple qubits simultaneously.</p>
