<p>An arbitrary single-qubit state can be written as:</p>
<p>$$
|\psi\rangle =
    \cos \frac{\theta}{2} |0 \rangle , + , e^{i\phi}  \sin \frac{\theta}{2} |1\rangle
$$</p>
<p>Here, $\theta$ is the angle between the state vector and the $Z$-axis, and $\phi$ is the longitude angle with respect to the $X$-axis on the Bloch sphere.</p>
<p>Our goal is to generate $0$ or $1$ with the probability of generating a $0$ equal to $x$ and the probability of generating a $1$ equal to $1 - x$. This means that the qubit state should look like</p>
<p>$$
|\psi\rangle =
    \sqrt x |0 \rangle + \sqrt{1 - x} |1\rangle
$$</p>
<p>Comparing the amplitudes of the state $|0 \rangle$ in the two equations, we get</p>
<p>$$
\sqrt x = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \Rightarrow \theta = 2 \arccos\sqrt x
$$</p>
<p>Since $\theta$ is the angle between the state vector and the $Z$-axis, we need to apply the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.ry"><code>Ry</code></a> gate with the calculated $\theta$ to the starting state $|0 \rangle$ to get the desired qubit state.</p>
<p>The <code>Ry</code> operation applies a given rotation about the $Y$-axis (i.e., in the $ZX$-plane). Hence, $\phi$ (longitude angle with respect to $X$-axis) is always equal to $0^{\circ}$, which means that the relative phase $e^{i\phi}$ doesn&#39;t have any impact on the resulting qubit state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can also calculate ${\theta}$ by comparing the amplitudes of the state $|1 \rangle$ in the two equations, which is $2 \arcsin\sqrt{1.0 - x}$</p>
