<p><strong>Input:</strong> A qubit which is guaranteed to be in either the $|0\rangle$ or the $|1\rangle$ state.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong>  <code>true</code> if the qubit was in the $|0\rangle$ state, or <code>false</code> if it was in the $|1\rangle$ state. The state of the qubit at the end of the operation does not matter.</p>
