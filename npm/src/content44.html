<p>This demo shows you how to allocate multiple qubits in Q# and examine their joint state. It uses single-qubit gates for manipulating the individual qubit states - if you need a refresher on them, please review the single-qubit gates kata.</p>
<p>These demos use the function <code>DumpMachine</code> to print the state of the quantum simulator.
If you aren&#39;t familiar with the output of this function for single qubits, you should revisit the qubit kata.
When printing the state of multi-qubit systems, this function outputs the same information for each multi-qubit basis state.
The qubit kata explains how <code>DumpMachine</code> works for multiple qubits in more detail.</p>
