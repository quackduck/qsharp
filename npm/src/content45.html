<p>You might have noticed that we&#39;ve been &quot;resetting&quot; the qubits at the end of our demos, that is, returning them to $|0\rangle$ state. Q# requires you to return your qubits into the $|0\rangle$ state before releasing them at the end of the <code>using</code> block.
The reason for this is entanglement.</p>
<p>Consider running a program on a quantum computer: the number of qubits is very limited, and you want to reuse the released qubits in other parts of the program.
If they are not in zero state by that time, they can potentially be still entangled with the qubits which are not yet released, thus operations you perform on them can affect the state of other parts of the program, causing erroneous and hard to debug behavior.</p>
<p>Resetting the qubits to zero state automatically when they go outside the scope of their using block is dangerous as well: if they were entangled with others, measuring them to reset them can affect the state of the unreleased qubits, and thus change the results of the program - without the developer noticing this.</p>
<p>The requirement that the qubits should be in zero state before they can be released aims to remind the developer to double-check that all necessary information has been properly extracted from the qubits, and that they are not entangled with unreleased qubits any more.</p>
<p>(An alternative way to break entanglement is to measure qubits; in this case Q# allows to release them regardless of the measurement result. You can learn more about measurements in the qubit kata.)</p>

<p>In the following exercises you will learn to prepare separable quantum states by manipulating individual qubits.
You will only need knowledge from the single-qubit gates kata for that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In each exercise, you&#39;ll be given an array of qubits to manipulate; you can access $i$-th element of the array <code>qs</code> as <code>qs[i]</code>.
Array elements are indexed starting with 0, the first array element corresponds to the leftmost qubit in Dirac notation.</p>
