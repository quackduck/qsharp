<p>Our first proper multi-qubit gate is the <code>CNOT</code> (&quot;controlled NOT&quot;) gate. The <code>CNOT</code> gate is a two-qubit gate, one is referred to as the <strong>control</strong> qubit, and the other one is the <strong>target</strong> qubit (usually the first qubit is the control, and the second qubit is the target).</p>
<p><code>CNOT</code> acts as a conditional gate of sorts: if the control qubit is in state $|1\rangle$, it applies the <code>X</code> gate to the target qubit, otherwise it does nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the system is in a superposition of several basis states, the effects of the gate will be a linear combination of the effects of it acting separately on each of the basis states.
This will be the case for all quantum gates you&#39;ll encounter later that are specified in terms of basis states: since all unitary gates are linear, it is sufficient to define their effect on the basis states, and use linearity to figure out their effect on any state.</p>

<p>The <code>CNOT</code> gate is particularly useful for preparing entangled states. Consider the following separable state:</p>
<p>$$\big(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle\big) \otimes |0\rangle = \alpha|00\rangle + \beta|10\rangle$$</p>
<p>If we apply the $\text{CNOT}$ gate to it, with the first qubit as the control, and the second as the target, we get the following state, which is not separable any longer:</p>
<p>$$\alpha|00\rangle + \beta|11\rangle$$</p>
<p>The <code>CNOT</code> gate is self-adjoint: applying it for the second time reverses its effect.</p>
