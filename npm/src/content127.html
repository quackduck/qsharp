<p>Let&#39;s reuse the <code>RandomBit</code> operation from the &quot;Generate A Single Random Bit&quot; exercise again.
We&#39;ll generate N random bits by calling <code>RandomBit</code> operation N times, and treat the result as a binary notation to convert it into an integer.
Since the maximum value of the number written with N bits is $2^N - 1$, we don&#39;t need to do any extra checks to ensure that the result is within the given range.</p>
