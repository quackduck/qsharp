<p>The basic building block of a classical computer is the bit - a single memory cell that is either in state $0$ or in state $1$. Similarly, the basic building block of a quantum computer is the quantum bit, or <strong>qubit</strong>. Like the classical bit, a qubit can be in state $0$ or in state $1$. Unlike the classical bit, however, the qubit isn&#39;t limited to just those two states - it may also be in a combination, or <strong>superposition</strong> of those states.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common misconception about quantum computing is that a qubit is always in state $1$ or state $0$, we just don&#39;t know which one until we &quot;measure&quot; it. That is not the case. A qubit in a superposition is in a linear combination of the states 0 and 1. When a qubit is measured, it is forced to collapse into one state or the other - in other words, measuring a qubit is a drastic process that changes its initial state.</p>

<h2>Matrix Representation</h2>
<p>The state of a qubit is represented by a complex vector of size 2:</p>
<p>$$\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p>Here $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers. $\alpha$ represents how &quot;close&quot; the qubit is to state $0$, and $\beta$ represents how &quot;close&quot; the qubit is to state $1$. This vector is normalized: $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.
α and β are known as the probability amplitudes of states 0 and 1, respectively.</p>
<p>$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are known as the probability amplitudes of states $0$ and $1$, respectively.</p>
<h2>Basis States</h2>
<p>A qubit in state $0$ would be represented by the following vector:</p>
<p>$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p>Likewise, a qubit in state $1$ would be represented by this vector:</p>
<p>$$\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p>Note that you can use scalar multiplication and vector addition to express any qubit state $\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix}$ as a sum of these two vectors with certain probability amplitudes $\alpha$ and $\beta$, known as linear combination.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \beta \end{bmatrix} =
\alpha \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + \beta \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>Because of this, qubit states $0$ and $1$ are known as basis states. These two vectors have two properties.</p>
<ol>
<li>They are normalized.</li>
</ol>
<p>$$
\langle \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \rangle =
\langle \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \rangle = 1
$$</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>They are orthogonal to each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>$$
\langle \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \rangle =
\langle \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \rangle = 0
$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a reminder, $\langle V , W \rangle$ is the inner product of $V$ and $W$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that these vectors form an <strong>orthonormal basis</strong>. The basis of $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ is called the <strong>computational basis</strong>, also known as the <strong>canonical basis</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There exist other orthonormal bases, for example, the <strong>Hadamard basis</strong>, formed by the vectors</p>
<p>$$\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix} \text{ and } \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p>You can check that these vectors are normalized, and orthogonal to each other. Any qubit state can be expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix} =
\frac{\alpha + \beta}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix} +
\frac{\alpha - \beta}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>The Hadamard basis is widely used in quantum computing, for example, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84" target="_blank">BB84 quantum key distribution protocol</a>.</p>
