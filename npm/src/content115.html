<p>Joint measurements, also known as Pauli measurements, are a generalization of 2-outcome measurements to multiple qubits and other bases. In Q#, joint measurements in Pauli bases are implemented using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.measure" target="_blank"><code>Measure</code></a> operation. Let&#39;s review single-qubit measurements in a different light before discussing joint measurements.</p>
<h2>Single-Qubit Pauli Measurement</h2>
<p>For single-qubit systems, any measurement corresponding to an orthogonal basis can be associated with a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues $\pm 1$. The possible measurement outcomes (represented as <code>Result</code> in Q#) are the eigenvalues of the Hermitian matrix, and the corresponding projection matrices for the measurement are the projection operators onto the <em>eigenspaces</em> corresponding to the eigenvalues.</p>
<p>For example, consider the computational basis measurement, which can result in outcomes <code>Zero</code> or <code>One</code> corresponding to states $\ket 0$ and $\ket 1$. This measurement is associated with the Pauli Z operator, which is given by</p>
<p>$$Z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1\end{pmatrix} = \ket{0}\bra{0} - \ket{1}\bra{1}$$</p>
<p>The $Z$ operator has two eigenvalues, $1$ and $-1$, with corresponding eigenvectors $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$. A $Z$-measurement is then a measurement in the $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$ basis, with the measurement outcomes being $1$ and $-1$ respectively. In Q#, by convention, an eigenvalue of $1$ corresponds to a <code>Result</code> of <code>Zero</code>, while an eigenvalue of $-1$ corresponds to a <code>Result</code> of <code>One</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, one can implement measurements corresponding to the Pauli X and Y operators. We summarize the various properties below:</p>

<p>In general, any measurement on a single qubit which results in two outcomes corresponds to the Hermitian operator $U Z U^\dagger$, for some $2\times 2$ unitary matrix $U$.</p>
<p>Joint measurements are a generalization of this principle for multi-qubit matrices.</p>
<h2>Parity Measurements</h2>
<p>The simplest joint measurement is a parity measurement. A parity measurement treats computational basis vectors differently depending on whether the number of 1&#39;s in the basis vector is even or odd.</p>
<p>For example, the operator $Z\otimes Z$, or $ZZ$ in short, is the parity measurement operator for a two-qubit system. The eigenvalues $1$ and $-1$ correspond to the subspaces spanned by basis vectors ${ |00\rangle, |11\rangle }$ and ${ |01\rangle, |10\rangle }$, respectively. That is, when a $ZZ$ measurement results in a <code>Zero</code> (i.e. the eigenvalue $+1$), the post-measurement state is a superposition of only those computational basis vectors which have an even number of $1$&#39;s. On the other hand, a result of <code>One</code> corresponds to a post-measurement state with only odd parity computational basis vectors.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what happens to various two-qubit states after the parity measurement. The $Z \otimes Z$ matrix for two qubits is:</p>
<p>$$
Z \otimes Z =
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>When this transformation is applied to a basis state $|00\rangle$, we get</p>
<p>$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>Comparing this to the characteristic equation for eigenvectors of $Z \otimes Z$ given by
$ Z \otimes Z |\psi\rangle = \lambda |\psi\rangle$,
it is easy to see that $|00\rangle$ belongs to the $+1$ eigenspace, hence the $Z \otimes Z$ measurement will return <code>Zero</code> and leave the state unchanged.</p>
<p>Similarly, it can easily be verified that $|11\rangle$ also belongs to $+1$ eigenspace, while $|01\rangle$ and $|10\rangle$ belong to the $-1$ eigenspace.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if we apply a $Z \otimes Z$ measurement to a superposition state $\alpha |00\rangle + \beta |11\rangle$? We can see that</p>
<p>$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \beta \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \beta \end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>So this state also belongs to the $+1$ eigenspace, and measuring it will return <code>Zero</code> and leave the state unchanged. Similarly, we can verify that an $\alpha |01\rangle + \beta |10\rangle$ state belongs to the $-1$ eigenspace, and measuring it will return <code>One</code> without changing the state.</p>
<p>Similarly, a parity measurement on a higher number of qubits can be implemented using a $Z \otimes \dotsc \otimes Z$ measurement.</p>
