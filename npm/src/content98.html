<p>As described in the previous sections, in theory it is possible to measure all the qubits in an $n$-qubit system simultaneously in an orthogonal basis. The post-measurement state of the qubits is then exactly one of the $2^n$ possible basis states.</p>
<p>In practice, this is implemented by measuring all the qubits one after another. For example, if one wants to measure a two-qubit system in the computational basis, one can implement this by first measuring the first qubit in the computational basis to obtain $0$ or $1$, and then measuring the second qubit in the computational basis. This can result in one of the four possible outcomes: $00, 01, 10, 11$.</p>
<p>This can be generalized to measurements in other bases, such as the 2-qubit Pauli X basis $\ket{++}, \ket{+-}, \ket{-+}, \ket{--}$, and the bases for larger numbers of qubits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that measurement of all qubits sequentially can only be done in orthogonal bases ${ \ket{b_i}}$, such that each $\ket{b_i}$ is a tensor product state. That is, each $\ket{b_i}$ must be of the form $\ket{v_0} \otimes \ket{v_1} \dotsc \otimes \ket{v_{n-1}}$, with each $\ket{v_j}$ being a single-qubit basis state.
For example, for the 2-qubit Pauli X basis $\ket{++}, \ket{+-}, \ket{-+}, \ket{--}$ each basis state is a tensor product of states $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$, which form a single-qubit basis state.</p>
<p>Measuring in orthogonal bases which contain states which are not tensor product states, such as the Bell basis, are trickier to implement, and require appropriate unitary rotations in addition to measuring all qubits one after another.
We will not discuss such measurements in this kata.</p>
<p>If we restrict ourselves to measurements in tensor product states, the distinction between measuring all the qubits simultaneously versus one after another is not important for an ideal quantum computer: in terms of the outcomes and measurement probabilities, both are identical. Furthermore, as long as all the qubits are measured, the sequence in which they are measured is also inconsequential. These factors can be  important in the case of real quantum computers with imperfect qubits, but we restrict the discussion to ideal systems in this kata.</p>
