<p>Since the state of the first qubit is different in these states ($\ket +$ and $\ket -$, respectively), it is sufficient to measure only the first qubit in the Pauli X basis in order to distinguish the two states. Furthermore, this measurement will not change the state of the system, since the post-projection state is identical to the original state regardless of the input state.</p>
