<p>We can reuse the <code>RandomBit</code> operation from the &quot;Generate A Single Random Bit&quot; exercise.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll generate an $N$-bit random number by calling the <code>RandomNBits</code> operation, where N is the bitsize of $max - min$. We can repeat this process until the result is less than or equal than $max - min$, and return that number plus $min$.</p>
