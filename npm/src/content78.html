<p>This kata introduces you to measurements done on single-qubit systems.</p>
<p>The concept of a measurement is a central part of quantum mechanics, as well as quantum algorithms. Single-qubit measurements, as their name implies, are measurements on single qubits. The outcomes of a measurement in quantum mechanics are probabilistic, and in general, change the state of the qubit according to the outcome of the measurement.</p>
<p>We recommend you complete the &quot;Single-Qubit Gates&quot; kata before starting this one.</p>
