<p>Complex numbers have a parameter called the phase. If a complex number $z = x + iy$ is written in polar form $z = re^{i\theta}$, its phase is $\theta$ where $\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$.</p>
<p>The probability amplitudes $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers, therefore $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have a phase. For example, consider a qubit in state $\frac{1 + i}{2}|0\rangle + \frac{1 - i}{2}|1\rangle$. If you do the math, you see that $\theta = tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}$. Thus, the phase of $|0\rangle$ is $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and the phase of $|1\rangle$ is $-\frac{\pi}{4}$. The difference between these two phases is known as <strong>relative phase</strong>.</p>
<p>Multiplying the state of the entire system by $e^{i\theta}$ doesn&#39;t affect the relative phase: $\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$ has the same relative phase as $e^{i\theta}\big(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle\big)$. In the second expression, $\theta$ is known as the system&#39;s <strong>global phase</strong>.</p>
<p>The state of a qubit (or, more generally, the state of a quantum system) is defined by its relative phase - global phase arises as a consequence of using linear algebra to represent qubits, and has no physical meaning. That is, applying a phase to the entire state of a system (multiplying the entire vector by $e^{i\theta}$ for any real $\theta$) doesn&#39;t actually affect the state of the system. Because of this, global phase is sometimes known as <strong>unobservable phase</strong> or <strong>hidden phase</strong>.</p>
