<p>The following code demonstrates that the theoretical and experimental values of the probability outcomes indeed match with each other. We repeatedly prepare the same state $\ket \psi = 0.6 \ket 0 + 0.8 \ket 1$ and measure it in the computational basis $100$ times. At the end, we expect 0 to be measured approximately $|0.6 |^2 \cdot 100= 36$ times, and 1 to be measured approximately $|0.8|^2 \cdot 100= 64$ times. Note that since measurements are probabilistic, we do not expect the results to match these values exactly. As we repeat the measurements, the resulting distribution will align with the theoretical probabilities.</p>
