<p>As a reminder, single-qubit gates are represented by $2\times2$ unitary matrices.</p>
<p>The effect of a gate applied to a qubit can be calculated by multiplying the corresponding matrix by the state vector of the qubit to get the resulting state vector.</p>
<p>Multi-qubit gates are represented by $2^N\times2^N$ matrices, where $N$ is the number of qubits the gate operates on. To apply this gate, you multiply the matrix by the state vector of the $N$-qubit quantum system.</p>
<h2 id="applying-gates-to-a-part-of-the-system">Applying Gates to a Part of the System</h2>
<p>The simplest thing we can do with multi-qubit systems is to apply gates to only a subset of qubits in the system.
Similar to how it is sometimes possible to represent the state of a multi-qubit systems as a tensor product of single-qubit states, you can construct gates that modify the state of a multi-qubit system as tensor products of gates that affect parts of the system.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider an example of applying single-qubit gates to one of the qubits of a two-qubit system.
If you want to apply an $X$ gate to the first qubit of the system and do nothing to the second qubit, the resulting gate will be represented as a tensor product of an $X$ gate and the identity gate $I$ which corresponds to doing nothing:</p>
<p>$$
X \otimes I =
\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>You can use the same approach when applying several gates to independent parts of the system at the same time.
For example, applying the $X$ gate to the first qubit and the $H$ gate to the second qubit would be represented as follows:</p>
<p>$$
X \otimes H =
\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\ 
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
    1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that we can use mixed-multiplication property of tensor product to see that this is equivalent to applying $X$ gate to the first qubit and applying $H$ gate to the second qubit, in either order:</p>
<p>$$X \otimes H = (I X) \otimes (H I) = (I \otimes H) (X \otimes I)$$
$$X \otimes H = (X I) \otimes (I H) = (X \otimes I) (I \otimes H)$$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach can be generalized to larger systems and gates that act on multiple qubits as well.
It is more complex when a multi-qubit gate is applied to a subset of qubits that are not &quot;adjacent&quot; to each other in the tensor product; we&#39;ll see an example later in this kata.</p>
