<p>This demo illustrates the equivalence of the measurement probabilities for simultaneous measurement on all qubits, and measurements on each of the qubits executed one after another. Using the wave function from exercise 1 above as an example, we show that the measurement probabilities obtained using the <code>M</code> operation in Q# are the same as those expected theoretically for exercise 1.</p>
<p>The simulated probabilities will be different for each run of <code>DemoBasisMeasurement</code>. The simulated and theoretical probabilities are not expected to be identical, since measurements are probabilistic. However, we expect the values to be similar, and the simulated probabilities to approach the theoretical probabilities as the parameter <code>numRuns</code> is increased.</p>
