<p>Exercises are problems that you have to solve by writing Q# code. In each exercise, you will be presented with placeholder code that you will have to fill in with the correct solution.</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> A qubit in the $|0\rangle$ state.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Apply the X gate to the qubit, i.e., perform a &quot;bit flip&quot; to set the qubit into the $|1\rangle$ state.</p>
