<p><strong>Input:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Generate a $0$ or $1$ with equal probability.</p>

  Use the allocated qubit, apply a quantum gate to it, measure it and use the result to return a $0$ or $1$.
</details>

<p><strong>Stretch goal:</strong> Can you find a different way to implement this operation?</p>
<details>
  <summary><b>Need a hint?</b></summary>
  What are the different quantum states that produce $0$ and $1$ measurement results with the same probability? How would measuring the qubit in a different basis change the result?
