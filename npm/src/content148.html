<p>Notice from the above demo that your phase oracle $U_{7,phase}$ behaves the same as the converted version of your marking oracle $U_{7,mark}$, both of which induce a phase flip on the basis state $|111\rangle$!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This way to convert a marking oracle to a phase oracle is useful because many quantum algorithms, such as Grover&#39;s search algorithm, rely on a phase oracle, but it is often easier to implement the function as a marking oracle. 
This converter provides a way to implement the function of interest as a marking oracle and then convert it into a phase oracle, which could then be leveraged in a quantum algorithm.</p>
