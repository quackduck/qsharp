<p>Quantum oracles are a key part of many quantum algorithms that rely on quantum implementation of a classical function. The algorithms&#39; discussions often assume that the quantum oracle that implements the function of interest is provided. Â This kata dives deeper into the definition of different types of quantum oracles, their properties, and the basic ways to implement the oracles.</p>
<p><strong>This kata covers the following topics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum oracles and how they relate to classical oracles</li>
<li>Two types of quantum oracles - phase oracles and marking oracles</li>
<li>Phase kickback and its uses for oracles implementation</li>
<li>Implementation and testing of quantum oracles in Q#</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you should know to start working on this kata:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental quantum concepts</li>
<li>Multi-qubit gates (especially controlled gates)</li>
</ul>
